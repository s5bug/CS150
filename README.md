# CS150

I am using Bazel to manage the "subproject" structure that is inherent to
coursework.

List of targets:
- `//week1-day1:helloworld`
- `//week1-day1:textbook-1-1`
- `//week2-day1:interview`
- `//week2-day2:restaurantbill`
- `//week3-day1:landcalculation`
- `//week3-day2:basketballplayerheight`
- `//week4-day1:stadiumseating`
- `//week4-day1:boxoffice`
- `//week4-day1:celsiustofahrenheit`
- `//week4-day2:lengthconversion`
- `//week5-day1:propertytax`
